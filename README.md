# Python Practice Questions

Welcome to the Python Practice Questions repository! This repository is designed to help you enhance your Python programming skills through a structured set of practice questions. Whether you're a beginner looking to build a strong foundation or an experienced developer aiming to sharpen your Python skills, this repository is for you.

## Introduction

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's an excellent choice for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and machine learning. To become proficient in Python, it's essential to practice and apply your knowledge.

The Python Practice Questions repository offers a comprehensive set of practice questions divided into weeks, with each week containing daily exercises. This structured approach allows you to progress gradually and steadily improve your Python skills.

## How to Use

You can use these practice questions to:

- Reinforce your understanding of Python fundamentals.
- Explore more advanced Python concepts and problem-solving.
- Develop practical coding skills through real-world examples.

Simply follow the weekly structure, starting with Week 1, and work through the questions day by day. Each question comes with a suggested list of concepts you should be familiar with to tackle the task successfully. If you're just getting started with Python, begin with Week 1 and gradually progress through the weeks.
